# 🚀 Dust5D: The Future of Federated, MFA-Secured Knowledge Networks

**Dust5D** is an advanced, cryptographically secured federated data system that leverages **Banano DAG-based MFA authentication** to ensure trustless, decentralized knowledge sharing. This repository implements a **secure AI-compatible data vault** where information is **encrypted, protected, and only accessible via cryptographic verification.**

---

## 🔥 Features
✅ **MFA-Protected Encryption** – Every data access request is validated through Banano DAG transactions.  
✅ **Federated Knowledge System** – Decentralized, trustless, and cryptographically secure.  
✅ **AI-Compatible Queries** – Enables secure AI processing of verifiable knowledge.  
✅ **SQL-Based Structured Storage** – Powered by SQLite with full encryption at rest.  
✅ **Adaptive Permission System** – Access is dynamically granted/revoked via Banano transactions.  
✅ **Immutable & Tamper-Proof Access Control** – Enforced by the Banano blockchain.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup
### **1️⃣ Clone the Repository**
```sh
 git clone https://github.com/your-repo/dust5d-node.git
 cd dust5d-node
```

### **2️⃣ Install Dependencies**
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **3️⃣ Initialize the Dust5D Node**
```sh
python setup.py
```
🚀 This will create a **secured SQLite database**, generate an **MFA-locked encryption key**, and initialize the **Banano DAG-based access system.**

---

## 🔐 Encrypted Data Management
### **Store Encrypted Data**
```sh
python insert_encrypted_data.py
```
✅ This will encrypt your data and store it **securely** in the database.

### **Query & Decrypt Data (MFA Required)**
```sh
python query_execution.py
```
✅ This will verify MFA authentication and **decrypt** the requested data securely.  
❌ If MFA is invalid, access is **denied.**

## 🔑 How Banano MFA Works
**Step 1:** The user sends a **Banano transaction** to the verification address.  
**Step 2:** The system **checks the Banano DAG** for a valid transaction.  
**Step 3:** If verified, **the encryption key is reconstructed**, and data is accessible.  
**Step 4:** If no valid MFA transaction is found, **access is denied.**
